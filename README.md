[Download Hype!](https://github.com/angusbeefsteak/Hype/releases)

## How to use

To Use Hype, Run the 'Run.bat' file in the zip package you downloaded!

## How to get an API Key (Inportant!)

As of update v1.2, users will have to provide their own Hypixel Network API Keys! Getting an API Key is Very simple!

On Minecraft Java, login to
```
mc.hypixel.net
```

Once connected, run the command ```
/api
```

You should be given an API Key to use with Hype! I also recomend saving it somewhere in a text document. (We provided one for you! How nice!)
